### Installation

Get a copy of the project

```git
git clone https://github.com/rawand-faraidun/todos.git
```

### Usage

-   Through the terminal install the necessary packages, within root folder, then both `client` and `server`:

```npm
npm i;
cd server; npm i;
cd client; npm i;
```

-   Pay attention to `.env.example` file in the `server` directory. rename it into `.env` or create a file with `.env` name and add the necesarry env variables.
-   Each `server` or `client` can be started directly from their npm commands, or you can the dev commands specified in outer `package.json`.

```npm
npm run server-dev
```

```npm
npm run client-dev
```

-   Or use `dev` command to run both concurrently.

```npm
npm run dev
```
